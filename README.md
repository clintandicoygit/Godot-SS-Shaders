## Installation

To use these shaders in your Godot project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/clintandicoygit/Godot-SS-Shaders.git
   ```
2. Open your Godot project.
3. Copy the shaders from the cloned directory into your project folder.
4. Import the shaders into your scenes as needed.

## Usage

Using shaders in Godot is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic guide to help you get started:

1. **Create a Shader Material**:
   - In your scene, select the node where you want to apply the shader.
   - Create a new `ShaderMaterial`.

2. **Assign the Shader**:
   - Open the `ShaderMaterial` properties.
   - Assign the shader file you copied to your project.

3. **Adjust Properties**:
   - Depending on the shader, you may find various properties to tweak.
   - Play with these settings to achieve the desired effect.

4. **Run Your Scene**:
   - Test your scene to see the shader in action.

### Example Shader

Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate how to create a basic shader:

```gdscript
shader_type canvas_item;

void fragment() {
    COLOR = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // Red color
}
```

This shader will render a red color on the specified object.
